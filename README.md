The evolving landscape of AI in robotics manifests its tangible impact on real-world applications. From self-driving vehicles and healthcare solutions to customer service, industrial automation, and service robots, AI serves as a transformative catalyst, enhancing industries and elevating daily life. While concerns exist regarding potential job displacement, the World Economic Forum (WEF) foresees AI and robotics generating 12 million more jobs than it displaces by 2025. This growth offers an opportunity for workforce retraining, reskilling initiatives, and strategic investments in knowledge aligned with evolving technologies. The amalgamation of AI and robotics holds the potential to reshape work responsibilities, automating routine tasks in factories and infusing flexibility and learning capabilities into mundane applications. The versatile applications of AI in robotics make this field both expansive and thrilling to explore.</td>

Several types of AI are already being employed by payers and providers of care, and life sciences companies. The key categories of applications involve diagnosis and treatment recommendations, patient engagement and adherence, and administrative activities. Although there are many instances in which AI can perform healthcare tasks as well or better than humans, implementation factors will prevent large-scale automation of healthcare professional jobs for a considerable period. Ethical issues in the application of AI to healthcare are also discussed.</td>
